* Design considerations
* Agility
* Component selection
* Effects of size

Question: Why don't all the rotors of a quadrotor spin in the same direction?
* Spinning all rotors in the same direction will cause the robot to constantly rotate.

## Rotor Physics
* Thrust is the [force](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/forces.html) which moves an aircraft through the air. Thrust is used to overcome the [drag](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/drag1.html) of an airplane, and to overcome the [weight](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/weight1.html) of a rocket. Thrust is generated by the **engines** of the aircraft through some kind of [propulsion system](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/bgp.html)
* In [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics "Fluid dynamics"), **drag** (sometimes called **air resistance**, a type of [friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction "Friction"), or **fluid resistance**, another type of friction or fluid friction) is a [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force "Force") acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid.
* Torque is a measure of the force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis. Just as force is what causes an object to accelerate in linear kinematics, torque is what causes an object to acquire angular acceleration.
* Motor Sizing Motor sizing refers to **the process of picking the correct motor for a given load**.

Every rotor has to support one forth of the weight in equilibrium (depends on number of rotors)

Determine the speed that will be required to produce one forth the weight for thrust equation

That speed will produce the thrust required to lift the drone off, and every rotor has to overcome the drag moment.

Have to size the motors, so they can produce the torque to overcome this drag moment.

Using the weight you can determine the basic operating speed for every rotor. That tells you what torque you need to apply at every motor.

![[Calculating the Force and Moment.png]]

Calculation of force -> constant of proportionality between the force and the square of the RPM

Calculation of moment -> constant of proportionality between the drag moment and the square of the RPM

At equilibrium, force and moment = 0

What is the resultant force?
When an object is subject to several forces, **the resultant force is the force that _alone_ produces the same acceleration as all those forces**.

Resultant force -> Sum of the four thrusts and the gravity force

The **Moment** of a force is a measure of its tendency to cause a body to rotate about a specific point or axis.

A reaction force is **a force that acts in the opposite direction to an action force**. Friction is the reaction force resulting from surface interaction and adhesion during sliding. Reaction forces and reaction moment are usually the result of the actions of applied forces.

Resultant moment ->  If you know where the center of mass is, quickly calculate moments about the center of mass for the 4 different rotors. The total amount is obtains by calculating, the moments due to the forces exerted by the rotors and the reactions due to the rotors spinning in counterclockwise or clockwise directions. Those reactions are moments and they add to the net moment.

When gravity pulls on an object, the action force is Earth's **center** pulling on an object's **center**. Thus, the reaction force is the object's **center** pulling on the Earth's **center**.


### Acceleration
![[Acceleration Physics.png]]

if increase motor speeds -> robot accelerate up
if decrease motor speeds -> robot accelerates down

A combination of motor thrusts and weight determine which way the robot accelerates.

Lets use x to measure the vertical displayment
* The acceleration is given by the second derivative of position
* u = sum of forces / mass
* u is equal to the second derivative of x

* The state of the systems is the position and velocity along the y axis
* position of mass (weight) -> x1 (y)
* velocity of mass -> x2 (y')
* The input to this system is an additional force on the mass.

4 states of this pendulum on a cart
* Position of the cart -> x1 (y)
* Position of the pendulum -> x2 (theta)
* Velocity of the cart -> x3 (y')
* Velocity of the pendulum -> x4 (theta velocity)
* The input is an additional force on the cart itself

* if we only look at the moment of the Quadrotor in the Z direction, as a result able to model it a one dimenionsional system for going up and going down.
* To completely characterize a motion of the quadrotor, need to know angular orientation, linear and angular velocities.
