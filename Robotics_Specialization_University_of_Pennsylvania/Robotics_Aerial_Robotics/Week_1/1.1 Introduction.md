### Types of Micro Air Vehicles
* Fixed wing 
	* Not able to stop in mid air
* Flapping wing
	* Insect Flight
	* Avian Flight
	* Flapping wing is able to stop and hover in mid air
* Rotor crafts
	* Helicopter
	* Ducted fan
	* Co-axial
		* Coaxial rotors or coax rotors are a pair of helicopter rotors mounted one above the other on concentric shafts, with the same axis of rotation, but turning in opposite directions (contra-rotating).

The vehicle of choice in this course is going to be a quadrotor
* Quadrotor - This vehicle has four motors powered by independent motors all mounted on a fixed frame 
* By making aerial vehicles smaller, they are safer and more maneuverable

### Quadrotors
The blades are short and stubby, so even when the robot turns suddenly, the gyroscopic moments dont cause the blades to flap, making it easier to control the vehicle

Pitch is the rotation of a vehicle about the transverse axis. Roll is the rotation of a vehicle about the longitudinal axis. Yaw is the rotation of a vehicle about the vertical axis

* If you vary the speeds of these independent motors, you are able to control the position and orientation of the robot

 ![[Quadrotor spin left stationary.png]]
* If you spin the rotor faster on the left side, it will cause the robot to pitch in one direction (Turn up from Y axis)

Imagine you wanna move the vehicle from one side to ther other

Translate Involves a series of motions to move the robot to the right in the horizontal direction
1. Pitch the robot forward
2. Thrust vector points in the horizontal direction
3. This allows the vehicle to accelerate forward
4. When nearing the destination, pitch the robot in the opposite direction
5. This creates a reverse thrust that allows it to slow down when it gets to its destination
6. Then we will have to pitch it back to equilibrium 

So any translation maneuver to move a drone can be quite complicated involving rolling or pitching while translating

A robot has six degrees of freedom
![[Six degrees of Freedom.png]]
The six degrees of freedom of a mobile unit are divided in two motional classes as described below.

**Translational envelopes:**
1.  Moving forward and backward on the X-axis. (Surge)
2.  Moving left and right on the Y-axis. (Sway)
3.  Moving up and down on the Z-axis. (Heave)

**Rotational envelopes:**
1.  Tilting side to side on the X-axis. ([Roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics "Flight dynamics"))
2.  Tilting forward and backward on the Y-axis. ([Pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics "Flight dynamics"))
3.  Turning left and right on the Z-axis. ([Yaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_dynamics "Flight dynamics"))

### Key components of Autonomous Flight
1. State Estimation
	* Estimate the position and velocity (including rotation and angular velocity of the robot)
2. Control
	* Command motors and produce desired actions in order to navigate to desired state
3. Mapping
	* The vehicle must have some basic capability to map its environment
4. Planning
	* Given a destination, the vehicle must be able to compute a trajectory, a safe path to go from one point to another

### State Estimation
In a laboratory setting, there are cameras to estimate the position of each reflective marker on the robot to measure its position

In larger aerial robots or drones, they will use GPS and other kinds of communication to determine where it is, relevant to the ship deck, and is able to perform autonomously.

Aerial robots need to be able to operate indoors, and outdoors, with no GPS. They need to be small, maneuverable, agile and fast to work through indoor complex environments.

Aerial robots can carry camera, sensors and laser rangefinders like the following to navigate inside complex indoor environments

Simultaneous Localization And Mapping
![[SLAM explanation.png]]

* Angular velocity is defined as the rate of change of the angular position of a rotating body.** 
* Linear velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement with respect to time when the object moves along a straight path.

Question: In this simple example, we assumed that the robot was two-dimensional and we ignored the orientation of the robot. For a real quadrotor in a three-dimensional environment, we must estimate (in addition to the environment geometry):

Answer: in addition to (c), the angular velocity of the robot![[Different size and types of aerial vehicles for SLAM.png]]

![[Experimental Platform that uses sensors to map beacons.png]]

![[AprilTag beacons for Aerial Vehicle.png]]

E.g Example in the lab, the experimental platform is able to localize itself with respect to these AprilTag beacons and hover autonomously.  There is a camera situated below the experimental platform to localize itself to these AprilTag beacons. The platform can switch between big and small markers to navigate height, and putting more markers for greater distance.

Using the AprilTag Beacon in the experiemental platform is a inexpensive replacement to the motion camera aerial vehicle which maps out the different pillars.
