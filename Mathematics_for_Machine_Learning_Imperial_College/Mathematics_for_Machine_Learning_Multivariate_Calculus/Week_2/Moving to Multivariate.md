### Variables, constants & context
Consider the following formula for Force
`F = ma + dv^2`

We consider the following components of F as key parameters and constants

### Jacobian
A jacobian is simply a vector that we can calculate for each location in this plot which points in the direction of the steepest uphill slope.

Point A is the steepest from this map. From the map we see where the contour lines are tightly packed, this is where we find our largest jacobian vectors such as at Point A
